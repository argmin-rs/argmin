# finitediff: Finite Differentiation

This crate contains a wide range of methods for the calculation of gradients, Jacobians and Hessians using forward and central differences.
The methods have been implemented for input vectors of the type `Vec<f64>` and `ndarray::Array1<f64>`.

See the [Documentation](https://argmin-rs.github.io/finitediff/finitediff/) for details.
